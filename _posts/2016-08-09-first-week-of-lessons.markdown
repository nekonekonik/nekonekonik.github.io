This week marks the first day and week of CS3216! I've met some familiar faces and many more new ones considering that I spent a year away from Singapore. Today's lecture was mainly on course introductions and it was conducted in a light-hearted manner by Dr. Colin Tan. The day ended with a Superheroes game where students get to collect each other's contacts and get to know each other's skills/specialties without having to appear like a stalker. I must say that the game was a great idea as an icebreaker for a class where most students are meeting each other for the first time yet still expected to find teammates to complement each other's skillsets.

***The above paragraph is just a boring introduction to today's blog post. Veterans of CS modules would know that there is nothing more thrilling than the release of assignments so chiongsters can have a head start and complete their work within a few days of their release (just joking, I hope nobody would actually do that in CS3216).***

The first assignment is on developing a Facebook-integrated application. The assignment is nicely segmented into manageable milestones and I really appreciate the little hand-holdings of different topics through the hyperlinks to facilitate self-learning. As I have prior experience in web development, I don't have much difficulty in understanding the assignment but I won't say the same for others who came from different backgrounds.

The exciting part of the assignment is that we get to decide what application we want to develop as long as it meets the assignment requirements. Having spent some time in the States, I was fortunate to be exposed to many innovative ideas in hackathons and the startup community. Hence, even if I'm unable to find a novel idea, I'm hoping to adopt existing ideas into the Singapore/ NUS context so that we can have something meaningful and interesting to work on. Some of the more memorable apps I've came across in the US are:

- **[Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/):**
An expenses app that keeps track of money owed and lent out to friends. The function of this app is really clear and it does it's job of splitting bills/ tracking the flow of money between friends really well. However, this app is more useful in the US because people normally use their debit/credit card to pay, making it difficult for friends to co-pay. In Singapore, the more common situation would be friends just co-paying with their cash notes and coins on the spot.

- **[Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/):**
Nextdoor is a social networking site for neighbours to connect with each other when they are looking to buy/sell furnitures, hiring babysitters in the vicinity, or even organising neighbourhood events. It even allows neighbours to look out and warn each other of dangers in the neighbourhood (e.g. wild coyotes attacking pets, break-ins). I came across this when my landlady wanted to sell her refrigerator and she was finding platforms apart from Craigslist to post her listing. As neighbourhoods in US cover a huge amount of space (unlike flats in Singapore), this social network allows neighbours to communicate easily with each other. New residents in the area can just type in their address and they will be immediately connected to their neighbourhood.

- **[Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/):**
I'm amazed at how people can pay $5 to outsource all sorts of things. I've actually had friends request for logo designs during hackathons (and they did win prizes at their hackathons after that), to even buying Facebook likes. Even though there may be issues at whether its morally right to pay others to help you in some of the requests, I think this platform addresses a real pain point of users when they lack the expertise/time to do something, yet they still had to get it done.  


*I do have some ideas on my own as well but I'm going to leave it to future posts instead since this post is getting long.*  


My groupmates and I are still in the midst of discussing what idea to work on, so do stay tune for more updates on our progress ;)
