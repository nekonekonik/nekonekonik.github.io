Hi. This is my first blog post regarding a Computer Science module, CS3216 Software Development on Evolving Platforms, held under NUS School of Computing. It is a week before the first semester of my 4th year (senior year) is about to start and I would like to pen (or type, hurhur) down what I would like to take away from this class.

My intention for joining this class is to hone my technical and designing capabilities, as well as to stretch myself to my limits. Over the past 3 years working with people within and outside school, I’ve sometimes received feedbacks that my app designs/ mockups are lacking or that I am not following good coding practices when working in teams. Picking up expertise in a field can’t be done overnight and I believe that gaining experience through different development projects is the key for me to be better at what I do.

**With that, I’ve come up with some points that I hope to get out of CS3216:**

- **Be exposed to more good UI/UX design practices:**  
One weakness I have is that even though I try to follow online design guidelines, my design results can still be rather inconsistent :(

- **Learn to be more flexible and supporting when working under different teams:**  
My experience has always been to work under the same team for extended periods of time and that means I would have time to get used to my teammates/colleagues working habits. To work with a new team every two weeks would be a new challenge for me to quickly get used to other people’s working habits.
 
- **Follow through with a complete product development lifecycle (and hopefully the idea is good to be continued outside of CS3216)**  
I think it’s rare for schools to have classes that make students validate, develop and then “sell” their working products. This sounds like a class for a product manager and from what I heard from a professor from Stanford University, there is no university in the world that has a degree for product managers. Hence, I am interested in what this class has to offer in that aspect.
