The semester is ending and I hope to take this chance to reflect on CS3216. The biggest takeaway for me in class would be taking the opportunity to pick up React and Redux (as well as experimenting with Angular 2). Other than that, I'm thankful for the opportunity to meet guest speakers who shared their knowledge on product prototyping, marketing, business modelling, information security, product scaling etc. I felt that the speakers gave a very nice introduction to their topic of interest, especially for those without any background knowledge of the topic. Fortunately or unfortunately, I happened to have taken classes in the said topics so the lectures felt like a refresher course of some sort, so I may not be the best person feedback on this :P

In terms of soft skills, I felt that I learnt to be more accomodating to others. Instead of being insistent on my way of doing things, I was more willing to give in to others when they don't see eye to eye, and let them explore other options before they end up (willingly) agreeing to use my ideas. *Disclaimer: I hope I don't come off as saying that I am always right, but rather, I happen to have experience in the topic at hand, yet my words were not given consideration by others :(*

To anyone contemplating to take CS3216, I would suggest taking it early (e.g Year 2/3, and before NOC). That's when many things mentioned in class are fresh and exciting to pick up. There isn't much fun when you've already known 75% of the class material :/
