For this week's CS3216 Lecture, we have two guest speakers, Bjorn Lee and Chris Cai, to talk about growth hacking and product ideation respectively. Bjorn, ex-product lead from Zopim and Zendesk, gave a talk about his growth hacking techniques used for Stickery, an educational games app startup that he had co-founded in 2010. On the other hand, Chris gave a product ideation exercise to discover solutions to existing problems.

Growth hacking refers to fast, cheap, short-lived experiments in getting users for early-stage startups. As buzzwordy as it seems, it is still important to note that the resulted growth can be short-term and unsustainable in the long run if the product isn't capable of supporting the weight of the growth. Bjorn is quick to note that startups shouldn't "over-groupon" their product -- over-emphasizing technical growth hacking that gives the illusion of growth in the company and neglecting the more sustainable, down-to-earth and long-term marketing.

Out of the 10 growth-hacking techniques shared by Bjorn, my personal favourites are "Stealing Your Competitor's PR Strategy", "Positioning in 'X for Y' terms" and "Fake It Till You Make It". 

- **Stealing Your Competitor's PR Strategy:**  
I find this tactic ingenious in gathering the contacts of the reporters who had written articles on rival competitor, and then contacting them to write good reviews on your product. Initially, I felt that this was an underhanded way of doing marketing for your product, yet after being in different clubs and societies in the past, it occurred to me that this type of marketing is not uncommon and it is actually effective in getting the word out to the public.

- **Positioning in 'X for Y' terms:**  
This is actually encouraged in the startup community in Silicon Valley and it is very effective in helping people understand your product quickly and easily. Across the span of my time preparing for a startup pitch competition in SV, my group and I consulted many startup mentors and they never failed to emphasize the importance of making our elevator pitch as succinct as possible by using businesses/terms (such as Uber/ AirBnb/ Facebook / Amazon for...) that people are familiar with so we can avoid spending time explaining old concepts. This is definitely a tried and tested technique and an absolute must-do.

- **Fake It Till You Make It:**  
This refers to creating fake accounts/posts/content to create an illusion of a vibrant and working community to attract users to come and use your product. When more and more users start using the product, they can create a sustainable community by themselves and none will remember how the days started with fake content. I have done this before (and I actually enjoy it ><) and it also doubles up as dogfooding on your own product, so why not? :D

For the second part of the session under Chris, we had a fun hands-on activity on product ideation for an existing problem. We learnt about finding target users for our solution, creating their user personas and user stories to aid in how we would picture our users in using our products which would lead us to better understand what features we would need in our product to solve their problem. 

I learnt a lot from these two great speakers in this week's session and I am anticipating the talks that are to come :D
