Three weeks into Assignment 3 (or 2 weeks excluding the overlap with Assignment 1) and I humbly declare myself as a frog in the well. Assignment 3 is full of first times --my first time using React even though I wanted to try it since 2 years ago, my first time working on Progressive Web Apps (haven't even heard of it because I missed this year's Google I/O and probably some other announcement on October 2015, or maybe I was just busy watching the next cat video), and this is also my first time building a timetable app (I thought it looked simple, until I spent the first few nights scratching my head to sleep...)

**React & Redux**  
Memories of my CS3217 assignments came flooding in as if it was just yesterday (I took it more than a year ago). The pain and struggle to finish a programming assignment without even knowing how to code brings tears to one's eye (LOL). Coming from an Angular background, the panic attacks and uncertainties over the first two weeks were real as I felt that I was lagging behind in the app development process. Although I am still not as competent as when developing on Angular, I'm glad I took the leap of faith to leave my comfort zone. I can see why front-end developers would want to use React. It gives the developer more control over the UI components and allows them to be easily utilized in many different places without having to copy-paste huge chunks of code. With Angular 2's final release over the past week, one just has to leave Angular 1's bandwagon no matter how late, right? (To my future employers, please don't let me work in Angular 1 anymore.)

**Progressive Web Apps**  
So I really did watch too many cat videos, but I did set aside time to read up on Progressive Web Applications :D The concept of bringing a web app functioning offline with service workers is revolutionary especially for people who don't have constant internet connection (that's like me till mid 2015). The ability to make splashscreens also makes it feel much more like a native app.

**Timetable App**  
When my team decided to work on bringing NUSMods to React, [I should have known it was trouble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNoKguSdy4Y) to take on the implementation of a timetable. Not that I would have passed the job to the next unsuspecting victim, but I had overlooked many little intricacies in the making of a timetable. The logic needed in not overlapping two concurrent classes and having to implement the timetable component in React instead of plucking some beautiful Angular timetable library right off from GitHub was a little (quite) too much for the sleep-deprived, caffeine-filled me. I'm glad I got past this hurdle and a big shoutout to my friends who helped me or listened to my rants, HERE'S A BIG HEART-FELT THANK YOU! :D  
*I hope I don't jinx anything before Assignment 3 ends lol.*

That's it for this week! On to the next feature!
