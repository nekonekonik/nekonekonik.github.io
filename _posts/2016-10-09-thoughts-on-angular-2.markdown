With the recent release of Angular 2 last month, it's an opportune moment to test it out with our final project and be at the forefront of web development. Being no expert in the subject matter, I will base my perceptions on Angular 2 based on my (somewhat limited) experience with React and Angular 1.

Having developed mostly on Angular 1 for the past one year, there was a very visible difference in the absence of scope and controller functionality, something that developers are heavily reliant on in Angular 1. In its place are components and directives that was what made me quite resistant to pick it up when Angular 2 was available for Developer Preview. Curious as it may seem, I felt that Angular 2 was a mish-mash of Angular 1 and React, perhaps because of the use of the component-based structure and I was able to understand Angular 2 more easily after using React. The use of TypeScript in Angular 2 may take some time getting use to but it does not present much of a hurdle to pick up. For long term Angular developers, the nostalgic ng-bindings are still a welcome sight in Angular 2.

As my team will be developing for both mobile and web platforms, we had decided to use NativeScript with Angular 2 to develop native mobile apps as that would allow us to reuse some of our code. After trying to set up a NativeScript (with Angular 2) project, I felt that a pain point was that there wasn't a way to develop both web and native apps together in the same project, similar to the Ionic framework or a React Native for web. This could be due to the inherent differences in how an Angular 2 and a NativeScript app is structured and built. In lieu of this issue, I am now in the midst of investigating whether Ionic 2 would be a better option for us to work on both web and native platforms.

To tie this post up, I felt that Angular 2 was easier to pick up than React, but I could be biased because I picked up React and Angular 1 before this.
