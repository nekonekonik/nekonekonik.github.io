How do startups know that they are building the right product for their customers?  
Many times, they don't.  

[An article](https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/11/are-you-building-the-right-product/) posted on TechCrunch in 2011 by Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, still holds true today as he talks about the inconvenient truths that any "improvements" or "new features" that we are adding into our products may not be bringing any real benefit to the users. We may be conducting interviews, user testings and product comparisons --the results may seem in favour of the product but at the end of the day, we will only know whether the product benefitted the customers if there are actual changes in customer behaviour.  

In the article, Eric Ries conducted an experiment in one of his startups by dividing his customers into groups depending on the day they joined. The experiment's hypothesis was that different groups of people will have a different form of behaviour. However, much to his dismay, the different groups had the same customer behaviour and the pattern stayed constant despite having the product made "better" each day and [vanity metrics](https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/30/vanity-metrics/) were showing good results.  

The solution, Eric suggested, is to **"stop using vanity metrics and start measuring progress more rigorously".**  

He further suggested product development as a science of some sort, where real experimentation with the users through split-testing (A/B testing) the product can provide insights on whether new features are worth the overheads to maintaining the new product. There are no "neutral" new feature, "neutral" would mean worse because of the overheads.  

Due to the limit of the duration of CS3216, I don't think we will have the luxury to do A/B testing with our users and it is unlikely that we will ever know whether we are building the right product for our users within the short span of 5 weeks. The objective of this post is some sort of reply to a conversation I was involved in previously --organising an application in a slightly different and improved format from your competitors does not mean you will have a better product, for all that you may know, their users may not even think that the feature is useful. Instead of just copying/modifying features from your competitors, it will be more effective if real user or experimentation was done to see whether the feature is a right fit for your users.  

Lastly, I would like to share a quote from the article on why user validation may not be useful as compared to real experimentation: **"Visionaries are right. Customers don’t know what they want. There’s plenty of good psychology research that shows that people are not able to accurately predict how they would behave in the future. So asking them, “Would you buy my product if it had these three features?” or “How would you react if we changed our product this way?” is a waste of time. They don’t know."**

*Vanity metrics: Things like registered users, downloads, and raw pageviews.  
Can be easily manipulated, and do not necessarily correlate to the numbers that matter: active users, engagement, the cost of getting new customers, and ultimately revenues and profits.*
