Considering that CS3216 has a marketing component to the project, and there are no marketeers in class, I thought it would be good to share my top 10 picks of social media marketing hacks from [this article from SocialMedia Examiner](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/20-plus-social-media-hacks-and-tips-from-the-pros/) that I think would be useful and relevant for our Final Project. The contributors are social media marketing experts who spoke at the Social Media Marketing World 2016.

**#1: Get Around the 140-Character Limit on Twitter**  
*First, send a tweet as you normally would … but end it with an ellipsis or a cliffhanger of some kind.*

*Next, reply to your own tweet! You can do this from your own stream. There’s no need to leave the @mention of yourself in there. Remove it so you don’t look like you’re talking to yourself. --Andy Crestodina*

This is an ingenious way of getting over the character limit! Interested readers can choose to read further by expanding the tweet and uninterested readers can just ignore it. I have seen users who post multiple tweets to complete their posts and what they ended up doing was to spam other people's feeds.

**#2: Accelerate Social Media Follower Growth**  
Accelerate social media growth by making mutually beneficial partnerships with other influencers in the market by the S4S (Share for Share, Shoutout for Shoutout) tactic. By sharing each other's content or tagging each other in the content, influencers can direct audience to each other's pages and achieve more audience outreach in a shorter time.

**#3: Reduce Inflammatory Facebook Fan Posts and Comments**  
Add words commonly used by Facebook attackers to the Page Moderation section in Page Settings so that negative comments get hidden from the general public.

**#4: Mute Trolls on Facebook**  
*When trolls commented on my Facebook posts, I used to delete the comments and sometimes ban the user.*

*I found that deleting the comments often caused the troll to post another comment complaining about the deletion – often citing “freedom of speech.” Banning the user deleted the comment and prohibited the user from posting again; however, I was often emailed with a “Why did you ban me?” complaint. Both options caused me more work and likely fostered hostility.*

*Now I just “hide” the comments.*  

*When you do this, only the person who made the comment and his followers can see the comment. From their perspective, the comment is still there but other people can’t see it. I’ve yet to have a troll complain that I hid his comment because he’d have to use another account and compare what he sees via the two accounts.*  

*And, here’s the kicker: I think troll comments add to the engagement factor, which increases the number of times Facebook displays the post and increases my reach. This is a very desirable goal. So in fact the troll’s comments are helping me.*  

*Either way I win: the troll figures I’ll hide his comment, so he stops trolling. Or he doesn’t figure out I hide his comments and he helps me increase my reach. --Guy Kawasaki*  

**#5: Schedule Multiple Tweets From a Single Blog Post**  
[missinglettr](https://missinglettr.com/) is useful tool that detects a new blog post from you and it will create a series of tweets, covering different parts of the article for you to post over the next year. May not be relevant to CS3216 but I still think its a noteworthy tool for any social influencer wannabe.  

**#6: Create Calls to Action That Are Hard to Miss**  
Use Instagram or Snapchat as a promo video and finish it off by adding appstore download links or website links along with the post!

**#7: Optimize Images for Multiple Social Media Platforms**  
A landscape photo may be suitable for Facebook and Twitter, however, a square image will be more suitable for Instagram and a portrait for Pinterest. To solve this, [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) has a magic button to resize button that creates multiple images for multiple platforms with just one click.

**#8: Include GIFs in Twitter (and Facebook)**  
GIFs are short video loops that can inject character and humor into your social media marketing. Not only is it more eye-catching to the audience, I heard that Facebook also tends to boost GIFs posts over photos or text posts.

**#9: Save Time Generating Branded Social Media Images**  
Use [Designfeed.io](http://www.designfeed.io/) to enter a headline and optional subtitle with your company logo to create a branded image for yourself!

**#10: Boost Reach and Engagement on Facebook**  
*There’s so much noise and saturation on Facebook that adding more content no longer seems to be the answer. Instead, posting only the best content that is highly targeted for your audience will produce better results. And posting less frequently seems to encourage the Facebook algorithm to share your content with more people. --Jenn Herman*
