For this week's Assignment 2 Application Seminar, I am allocated Discord for my application critique. Discord is a free voice and text chat for gamers much similar to Skype (without the video functionality) and TeamSpeak. As a non-gamer, I was curious of how this app actually works and I decided to pay a visit to the [Discord webpage](https://discordapp.com/).

The first thing I was greeted by was a "Download for OS X" and "Open Discord" button. Being a casual visitor, I immediately clicked on the "Open Discord" button and I was met with a nickname request.

Half-expecting another page requesting for more user information, I was caught off guard when it only requested for a server name after which it promptly brings me to a channel.

Within three steps, I managed to enter Discord and use it without supplying any personal information or downloading anything. I can already see why gamers would like to use this app because of the anonymity and low barriers of entry it provides for the user. On the other hand, even though Skype can be used online, it requires account login information and for TeamSpeak, it requires downloading before it can be used. At this point of using Discord, it does give a better experience than Skype and TeamSpeak.

With this limited hands-on experience with the app, I attempt to address the points mentioned by the presenters for Discord.

The presenters mentioned a valid point that no real user profiles are associated with the users (they have cartoon profile pics) which can be a problem because you may text the wrong person by accident. However, I wish to come from another point of view that because Discord allows anyone with an internet access to use their app, anonymity is an important feature and not having real profiles associated with the user can be seen as a plus point. Moreover, even in gamerooms, only the player nicknames are shown. Hence, Discord may just be mimicking the anonymity of gamerooms and does not intend to associate real profiles to users.

The presenters also brought up the point that it is difficult to monetize Discord because its core functionality are free and they may be planning to monetize through optional cosmetics like themes, sticker packs and sound packs (this is also mentioned in their page). I don't exactly like the idea of it because users will have to give out their user information to purchase these packs and the anonymity that I see as a feature now will probably be removed in the future. Perhaps a better business model would be through advertising for game companies so we can preserve user anonymity :D

Another point the presenters noted was that Discord does not have a search feature in its chat. In my opinion, due to the transient nature of messages in gamerooms (e.g. the message content is usually only useful for a period of time within the gameplay), perhaps a search is not necessary for Discord. In comparison to the usage of Slack for businesses, messages in Slack are usually of important content and hence the search function is more important to them.

Overall, I really like the ease of using Discord and the anonymity that comes with it. However, if Discord were to shift its target to other non-user groups, a search function in the chatrooms would prove to be useful.
