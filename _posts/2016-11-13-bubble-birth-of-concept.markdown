STEPS had just ended two days ago and CS3216 had more or less ended but I would still like to take this opportunity to talk about my Final Project --Bubble. Bubble is an anonymous chat application and the story of its origins may differ from person to person (which my team members, Zhi An, Michelle and Larry may blog about).

To me, the original concept was to come out with a fun, random, one-to-one video-calling app for NUS students to talk to each other (much like Omegle, or the notorious counterpart, ChatRoulette). However, there were safety concerns regarding video-calling random strangers online (even though they might be from NUS), and there was the problem of whether our free one-year Amazon server would be able to handle the load of that many video-calls. With that, the video-calling portion of the chat was scraped off and what we had left was the idea of an anonymous chat.

However, Bubble was not only meant be an anonymous chat. It was later designed to help stressed/depressed people seek help from others anonymously and allow other people to raise the attention of professionals or the university's care advisors to those who are at risk. Unfortunately, we were too ambitious to decide to work on 3 platforms (web, Android and iOS) with only 4 developers and we were not able to deliver the features to support giving users the ability to notify the university's care team. Moreover, the responses from the university's care teams were not entirely positive, which was quite a pity as there is real value to the application if the care teams can be successfully roped it after seeing the number of posts of students in distress after every examination period.

After all the twists and turns, we ended up back to our plan of having a fun, anonymous chat :D
